           <p>The Asset Chain is the native blockchain for Xend Finance’s Real-World Asset OAE (Onchain Asset Environment)-
                created to allow the seamless onboarding of all legally transactable asset types on-chain. We’re excited to announce the introduction of the Asset Chain Testnet, so the Xend community can acquire the first taste of easy and smooth RWA tokenization, verification, and management, increasing accessibility for diverse investment opportunities!
                What’s more, we’ll soon have a series of exciting tasks and airdrops for our beloved community members, so do stay tuned for it!</p>
                <h3>What is the Xend Finance Asset Chain?</h3>
                <p>The Asset Chain is a decentralized, open-source smart contract platform with the goal to enable quick, secure, and scalable infrastructure for dApps. Lachesis, an aBFT consensus protocol designed by the Fantom Foundation, powers the Asset Chain, making it both faster and cheaper than contemporaries without trading away security.
   
                   Lachesis enables scaling transaction throughput while maintaining instant finality without an increased risk of centralization.
                   
                   Notably, we will be making the Asset Chain repositories open-source for greater transparency; our users can both see the code and build upon it.</p>
                   <h3>Primary features of Asset Chain</h3>
                    <p>Here are the most prominent features of Xend Finance’s Asset Chain:</p>
                    <ul>
                       <li>The Asset Chain attains transaction finality averagely within 1–2 seconds.</li>
                       <li>It can process up to 5000 transactions every second.</li>
                       <li>The Asset Chain can scale to accommodate nodes numbering in hundreds of thousands.</li>
                       <li>The Asset Chain offers ‘absolute finality’, which essentially means that transactions, 
                           once done, can not be reverted under any circumstances.</li>
                       <li>The Asset Chain is completely compatible with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), 
                           which means developers are offered the same level of convenience in deploying smart contracts as on Ethereum.</li>
                       <li>The Asset Chain is completely compatible with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), which means developers are offered
                            the same level of convenience in deploying smart contracts as on Ethereum.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Proof of stake</h3>
                    <p>Xend Finance’s Asset Chain relies on Proof-of-Stake to prevent Sybil attacks (a bad actor creating multiple
                        identities to control a network). In fact, the Asset Chain requires a node to stake a minimum amount of 30,000 RWA to compete to validate transactions on the Asset Chain.
   
                       This is how you can understand Xend Finance’s PoS mechanism in a simple manner: validator nodes are in charge of
                        validating transactions, and the staked tokens serve as an economic incentive making them -</p>
                        <p>On that note, rewards distribution on the Asset Chain is controlled by the ‘Special Fee Contract.’ This contract is subject to change without hard forks as per 
                           the rules of governance. At the moment, here’s how reward is distributed:</p>
                           <ul>
                               <li>20% goes to the Xend Finance Ecosystem Treasury</li>
                               <li>80% goes to the validators, chosen for each round of transaction verification and block creation</li>
                           </ul>
                           <h3>Products deployed on the Asset Chain Testnet</h3>
